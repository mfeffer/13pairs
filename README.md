# MeSA-13
Repository for hosting the sheet music of 13 works and their corresponding audio performances with alignments that map between the two. These alignments were generated in a semi-automated fashion via the **M**easure to **S**ound **A**nnotator (`MeSA`).

Every folder except the `videos` folder contains
1. A PDF containing sheet music (generated from software or scanned from a hardcopy)
2. A sound file containing a recording of a corresponding performance
3. A JSON file with measure-level alignment between the sheet music and performance (by mapping measure bounding boxes in the sheet music to timestamps in the performance audio)

The `videos` folder contains visualizations of these alignments that can also be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/watch?v=WLVYJzgy7nU&list=PL4DZweX7nGV6XEFAES1r8gBClBHxkFALK).
